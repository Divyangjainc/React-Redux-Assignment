Q.4.What is the second argument that can optionally be passed tosetState and what is its purpose?
Ans.The second argument to setState in React is an optional callback function. It is executed
immediately after setState has completed and the component has re-rendered. Its purpose is to
allow you to run code that depends on the updated state, ensuring that you are working with the
new state value rather than the previous one.

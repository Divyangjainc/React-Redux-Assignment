Q.1.What is Redux ?
Ans.Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It provides a centralized store to manage an
application's state, making it easier to maintain, debug, and test, especially as the application grows in
complexity. Redux is often used with React (through React-Redux), but it can be used with other JavaScript
frameworks or libraries as well.

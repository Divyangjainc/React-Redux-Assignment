Q.3.What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component over Component?
Ans.A Pure Component in React is a class component that automatically implements the shouldComponentUpdate
lifecycle method with a shallow comparison of props and state. This mechanism prevents unnecessary
re-renders of the component if its props and state have not genuinely changed, leading to performance
optimization. In essence, if the new props and state are shallowly equal to the previous ones, the component
will not re-render.
